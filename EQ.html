            Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions, <br>
            as well as the emotions of others. Emotional intelligence is generally said to include a  <br>
            few skills: namely emotional awareness, or the ability to identify and name one’s own  
            emotions; the ability to harness those emotions and apply them to tasks like thinking and  
            problem solving; and the ability to manage emotions, which includes both regulating one’s  
             own emotions when necessary and helping others to do the same. <br>

            <br>
        
       <br>
    <h7> INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT</h7> <br> 
    Intelligence quotient, or IQ, is a number derived from a standardized intelligence test.
     On the original IQ tests, scores were calculated by dividing the individual's mental age by
      their chronological age and then multiplying that number by 100.<br> 

    So, a child with a mental age of 15 and a chronological age of 10 would have an IQ of 150. 
    Today, scores on most IQ tests are calculated by comparing the test taker's score to the average 
    scores of other people in the same age group. IQ represents abilities such as: <br>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Visual and spatial processing </li>
   <li>Knowledge of the world</li>
   <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
   <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
   <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>

     </ul>
