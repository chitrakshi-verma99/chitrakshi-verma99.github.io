        <H1>What are the difference between margin, border and padding in web design? </H1>

        <div class=" box-content">
        <p>Margin is how much space is around an object. <br>

            Padding is how much space is within an object sides and it’s contents. <br>
            
            Border is between the margin and padding of an object. Only counted when given an actual <br>
            width otherwise, it’s zero.
            
            The place where it all matters is defining width. Say you have a shoe box that is 12 inches <br>
            long and six inches wide. No lid and you’re looking down into the box. Imagine the paper stuffing <br>
             around the shoe. The shoe is the content, the paper is the padding and the box edge is the border. <br>
             We’ll say the border is 1 inch so we can see the actual edge. Now place another box next to it, six <br>
             inches away. That is the margin…the space between the two boxes. Still looking down on now two boxes, <br>
             in CSS if you want to draw a container around both of those boxes, the width of that new container would <br>
             be the:
            
            Width of the box 1: 6 inches+ width of box 2: 6 inches + the margin between them: 6 inches plus, <br>
            border of box1: 1 inch on each side so 2 inches + another 2 inches for the border on box 2.<br>
             Your width for the container wrapped around both shoe boxes would be:<br>
            
            6 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 =22 inches wide <br>
            
            Hope it helps.  <br>
