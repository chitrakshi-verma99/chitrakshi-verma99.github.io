        <h5>What are the difference between margin, border and padding in web design?

        <div class="explain">
        <p>Margin is how much space is around an object. <br>

            Padding is how much space is within an object sides and it’s contents. <br>
            
            Border is between the margin and padding of an object. Only counted when given an actual <br>
            width otherwise, it’s zero.
            
            The place where it all matters is defining width. Say you have a shoe box that is 12 inches <br>
            long and six inches wide. No lid and you’re looking down into the box. Imagine the paper stuffing 
             around the shoe. The shoe is the content, the paper is the padding and the box edge is the border. <br>
             We’ll say the border is 1 inch so we can see the actual edge. Now place another box next to it, six 
             inches away. That is the margin…the space between the two boxes. Still looking down on now two boxes, <br>
             in CSS if you want to draw a container around both of those boxes, the width of that new container would  
             be the:
            
            Width of the box 1: 6 inches+ width of box 2: 6 inches + the margin between them: 6 inches plus, <br>
            border of box1: 1 inch on each side so 2 inches + another 2 inches for the border on box 2.<br>
             Your width for the container wrapped around both shoe boxes would be:<br>
            
            6 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 =22 inches wide <br>
            
            Hope it helps.  <br>
