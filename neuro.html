         Neuroplasticity: The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections 
         throughout life. Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate 
         for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to
          changes in their environment. <br>
          How does neuroplasticity come about? While the individual working unit of the brain is the 
          single neuron, even simple tasks require the recruitment of vast numbers of interconnected 
          neurons functioning as a unit or network devoted to accomplishing even the simplest activity.
          he neural network represents a specific unique pattern of connections of neurons that fire in a
           specified sequence that allows you to accomplish such tasks as snapping your fingers, or 
           recalling the lyrics to Hey Jude. And neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to adapt and 
           change, is predicated on the modification of existing neural networks and the creation of new 
           ones. <br> 
           <h6>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h6>
           <p4>
               <ul>
                   <li>1. Feed your brain<br>
                    Your brain makes up only a tiny proportion of your total body weight, but it uses
                     up a quarter of everything you eat. If you want enhanced neural pathways, you’ll
                      need an enhanced diet. According to Ramsden, that means grabbing snacks like 
                      walnuts, blueberries, and avocado during the day. Vitamin D and magnesium are top
                       priorities if you want to promote neuroplasticity.  </li>
                   <li>2. Take naps<br>
                    Obviously a good night’s sleep of between seven and nine hours will always set you
                    up for a better brain day. But a short afternoon nap of around 20 minutes will
                     elevate your neuroplasticity potential even further. A short nap encourages the
                      growth of dendritic spines, which act as crucial connectors between the neurons
                       in your brain. </li>
                   <li>6. Learn to juggle <br>
                    Juggling is frequently cited as an excellent means for improving neuroplasticity.
                     Keep a small set of balls in your work drawer for a brain boost whenever you have
                      a few spare seconds between tasks. The better you get, the bigger the benefits. </li>
                   <li>4. Expand your vocabulary <br>
                    Try to learn one new word every day. According to experts
                    , this simple act will spark a multitude of new neural pathways, both visual and auditory.</li>
                   <li>5. Learn an Instrument<br>
                    Brain scans on musicians show heightened connectivity between brain regions. 
                    Neuroscientists explain that playing a musical instrument is an intense, 
                    multi-sensory experience. The association of motor actions with specific sounds 
                    and visual patterns leads to the formation of new neural networks.
                    If you've always wanted to learn an instrument, consider brain growth as a motivator to
                     get you started.</li>
                   
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h6>What is a growth mindset, and why is it important? </h6>
                Many students tend to give up when they encounter failure and hardship in studies
                because they believe that it means they are simply not good at the subject, or that 
                hey lack the level of intelligence necessary to excel at the subject. This is what is
                referred to as a fixed mindset. However, students can also have what is referred to 
                as a growth mindset, which states that the brain is capable of overcoming the 
                challenges it faces in new areas of learning. It is possible to develop a growth 
                mindset, and doing so can help a student overcome the hurdles they face in learning 
                and develop the necessary skills to persist. For example, a growth mindset in young
                girls who struggle with maths can help them recognize the fact that it certainly had
                nothing to do with their gender. Here, a growth mindset would help them persist in
                their efforts and try new learning techniques in order to improve their maths 
                skills, rather than give up because they believe that they are genetically doomed
                to fail at the subject. Similarly, a child from an impoverished background can,
                with the help of a growth mindset, learn to take his or her individual 
                difficulties in their stride in order to overcome those hurdles. The same concept
                applies for young people with learning or physical disabilities: a growth mindset
                works to instill confidence in a student regarding their ability to develop and
                learn.
