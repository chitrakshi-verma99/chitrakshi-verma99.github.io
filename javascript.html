       <h7> HTML </h7> <br>
        HTML is a markup language that we use to describe its content and layout a basic rough structure of a website.<br>
        
        Analogy: <br> HTML is the frame and content of a house. So things like chairs, tables, doors, stairs, the bare essentials of 
        what constitutes a house, nothing more.
        HTML developers’ job is to supply the bare minimum requirements of a website by describing the content of the website correctly so when the designers come in, they know what’s a button and what’s a paragraph.<br>


      <br> <h7> CSS</h7> <br>

        CSS is a styling language that we use to shape and style website content in terms of colors, typography, spacing, borders, and more.<br>
        Analogy:<br> CSS is the paint and the rounded edges of a house that makes visually appealing and comfortable to live in. Technically, 

        the definition of a chair is something that you sit on, but things like shape, size, and padding (design) is what makes chairs comfortable (or uncomfortable) to sit on.
        CSS developers’ job is to make sure that a website has the right visual style that the owner wants in terms of color, typography, spacing, shape, and overall layout when viewed on different devices.
       
        <br><h7> JavaScript</h7> <br>
       
        JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that allows you to make websites interactive, and reactive.<br>

        Analogy:<br> JavaScript is the electricity and water supply that makes a modern home a modern home, and makes taking baths, cooking food, and not freezing 
        to death during the winter possible. A JavaScript developer make sure that light switches on when you flip the switch, and hot/cold water comes out when you turn the water tap.

       <h6>  Control flow and loops</h6>
    <div class="explain"> 
        Control flow is in computer science the order that the instructions or statements or functions are executed. 
        In javascript, we read the code starting from the first line till the last line unless of course 
        in the code there is some instructions or statements that changes that control flow.
        Within an imperative programming language, a control flow statement is a statement that
         results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow. <br>

         Loops are iteration statements that will keep running until there is either
          nothing left to loop over, or if the condition becomes false. 
          There are many types of loops in JavaScript, but for now I’m going to be going over two of them.
           Let’s start with the most common used one, the for loop. 
           The for is a conditional loop, which means that it runs based on if a certain condition is true. 
           As long as it stays true, the code is going to keep executing.<br> 
           <br> 
         const edm = ['House', 'Dubstep', 'Drum and Bass'] <br>
         for (let i = 0; i < edm.length; i++) {<br>
         console.log(edm[i]) }<br>
                        // 'House'<br>
                        // 'Dubstep'<br>
                       // 'Drum and Bass'<br>
       Let’s break down what’s going on here. The syntax for a for loop contains a variable declaration
        of i which is the index of the array edm that we are currently iterating over. 
        After that we have the condition that checks if i is less than the length of our array,
         followed by an increase in i. <br>
         Basically, the for loop is saying to itself “okay so the index is 0, as long as that’s less
          than the length of the array, we are going to execute the code inside the code block and
           increase the value of i by one”. These three statements within the loop are optional though,
           as you can simply write for(;;){...} which would be an infinite loop.<br>

        <br> The while loop is similar to the for loop because it also runs while a condition is true. 
        The difference between them is that you would use a for loop when you already know how many 
        times you want the loop to be executed. A while loop is used when you are unsure about how many
         times the loop wants to run.<br>

        const edm = ['House', 'Dubstep', 'Drum and Bass']<br>
        while (edm.length > 0) {<br>
         const genre = edm.pop()<br>
         console.log(genre)} <br>

        // 'Drum and Bass'<br>
        // 'Dubstep'<br>
        // 'House'<br>
        This loop is saying “run the code in this code block only if the length of the edm array 
        is less than 0. An infinite loop in this situation would be if the condition in the while loop 
        is always true. Ex while (true) {...} .<br> </div>

        <h6> What is the DOM?</h6>
      <div class="explain">
      The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML. 
      It translates the content of an HTML document into a standardized object that functional 
      programming languages like JavaScript can easily access and modify. Since most web page events 
      are driven by non-HTML code, all dynamic web pages rely on the DOM to display and function
       properly.<br>
       Elements in an HTML document are structured this way for the same reason as objects:
        A hierarchical structure helps computer programs to read and process the information. 
        In the case of HTML, your web browser is the program, and scripting languages like JavaScript
         are what change and modify the HTML code.<br>
      But, there’s a problem. HTML documents by themselves are not objects. They cannot be read by 
      JavaScript without some sort of file-to-object translation. This is where the DOM comes in.
    The DOM represents an entire HTML document as a single object. To create the DOM, the web browser
     reading the HTML file takes in all its parts, from the root htmlelement to the smallest span tags,
          and outputs them as an object that JavaScript understands.<br>
       The word “represent” is important here. The DOM is not a copy of the HTML file — it’s simply 
       a different way that the web browser organizes the HTML information.<br></div>

       <h6> Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h6>

        <div class = "explain" >
        Arrays are a native part of the Java language. Objects are types that are defined by the
        programmer and which inherit from Java.lang.object (or another one of its children.)
         Objects are defined by a Class definition, and like all instances of classes,
          can contain both state (data) and behavior (code, in the form of methods acting on the 
          state and/or other data provided as parameters.). Arrays, in contrast, are defined in code
           using the special array syntax and keywords in the language, without having to define a class that creates the array’s capabilities.<br>
           <br>
           <br>
           <u>Accessing Elements</u>   <br> 

         If you just need to get the value of an element in an array (without updating it), 
         it’s simple if you know the index, and not much harder if you don’t (but you know something about the element you’re looking for): <br>

        const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'clementine'];<br>
        const secondFruit = fruits[1]; <br>
              // 'banana'<br>
         const clementine = fruits.find(fruit => fruit === 'clementine'); <br>
             // 'clementine' <br>
         Accessing object properties is easy too: <br>
         const box = { width: 4, height: 3, color: 'blue' }; <br>
        const boxColor = box.color <br>
        // 'blue' <br>
        </div >
     
     <h6>What functions are and why they are useful </h6> 
       <div class= "explain">
     Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. 
     A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that
      performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function,
       it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship 
       between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the 
       scope from which you wish to call it. <br>
       A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of
        the function keyword, followed by:
       The name of the function.
       A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
       The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.
