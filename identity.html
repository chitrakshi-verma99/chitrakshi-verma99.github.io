          I have been in hospitality since I was 19, working as a full-time chef. When i was living in Wellington,I made many friends, most 
          of them were travellers. I had a best friend who was also a chef, And the person ended up opening their own Eatery <br>
          on Cuba street. I left my 2-Hat-Restaurent job, and ended up working for my friend as a Sous-chef. I was managing a staff <br>
          of 10 people. During these times , the relationship of An Owner and an employee was coming in the way of friendship. <br>
           We had differences in deciding the Menu's and ended up in an argument. At that moment I had a hard decision to make <br>
           choosing between my happy professional life and a friendship that is no longer beneficial or healthy. <br>
           I choose my happiness as I respect my self and knew I deserved better. I changed my job and felt way more satisfied on a professional 
           end.

          I grew up in a country with a diverse culture and highly traditional people. My indian background influnced me a lot growing up 
          defining most of my values and me as an Individual. I was made to believe things that no one knows in the outside world. Yet, it was all 
          family and tradition. Now that I live away from my birth country and family, I have seen a drastic change in how I am adaptible to my surroundings
          and how I settled in a new country all these years. Honestly, If I move back to New Delhi, I wouldn't be the same person or would have a bit difficulty
          changing back to my older ways! My point of veiw of looking at life has changed,So I do not think I can follow my family traditions 100% now.
