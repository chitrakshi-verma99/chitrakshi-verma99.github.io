                <li> <b> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</b> <br>
                    I have learnt a lot from Core study in the past few weeks. I have been using the idea and practicing Emotional Intelligence
                    more in my life now. Having to manage people in my previous career, i learnt a lot about being aware of my surrounding,
                    about the people and how they feel and how i react with more empathy. I also enjoyed Listening and looping. It was a fun exercise 
                    to get to know the rest of the EDA students. The third topic I found really interesting was
                     Neuroplasticity as I've got a science background too, and I love Human Anatomy and Physiology.
                     the idea of our brain being the eternal power to control our habits and daily life, really excites me.</li>
                 <li>
                    <b>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming? </b><br>
                    Empathy is a way of connecting with other people that shows you understand that they’re experiencing something meaningful—even 
                    though you may not understand exactly how it feels for them. In other words, empathy is about finding a way to connect and to 
                    be able to say, “I want to understand how this feels to you and let you know that you’re not alone.”
                    Understanding other people's emotions is a key skill in the workplace. It can enable us to resolve conflicts,
                     to build more productive teams, and to improve our relationships with co-workers, clients and customers.
                     Anyone who is dedicated to self-improvement, personal development or the higher goal of spiritual growth needs to actively seek 
                     to understand oneself. This is because only when one understands where one lacks, can he or she focus their
                      efforts on what to improve.
                 </li>    <br>
                 <li><b> What has surprised you the most about the core learning?   </b> <br>
                    Tbh, I haven't really been surprised. I did expect us to learn some Human skills. and honestly,
                    its an awesome idea teaching students these core topic which actually relate to daily life. </li> <br>


                   <li> <b> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing 
                       on core learning in a web development bootcamp course? </b><br>
                       I think as i stated earlier, Its awesome. I have been in a dynamic industry since years and I have worked with people 
                       older than me and having no sense of how to show empathy or be emotionally intelligent around others. I believe 
                       Human Skills is very important at a workplace or at any institution involving humans!</li><br>
                      
                       
                    <li> <b> Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
                        Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead?.</b> <br>
                         Not really I mean having a learning plan is great which keeps us on track and if we feel a bit lost, we can always cross reference
                         of where we are heading. It seems like a good start. Studying core in between programming gave me a good break from ABC... of Coding. 
                         it was fun experience. i would definately recommend the experience of Foundations to my fellow friends if they get interested in programming :D. </li>
