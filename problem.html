        I got stuck on many problems this week, but I used some problem solving techniques and got throught the problems.
        One of the problem I got stuck on is this one , below, from Built-in methods Kata Challenge. we were asked to 
        <i>find</i> the door number that Scooby is hiding behind. We may want to use console.log or the tests in the
         functions.test.js file to help us solve this one. <br> 
         <br>

         <br>
         In the start, I was trying to use If/Else function to get to the solution, but after long hours of research on the internet,
         I found out I can use a 'for' Loop and keep looping till Scooby is found. So I did something thing like this, <br>
         <img src="./images/soln.JPG"> <br>
         <br>
         When I ran this code, I passed all the later tests to come , maybe like 2 more, just like that!!! I felt really happy.
         Using the For Loop helped to ignore writing one statements many times, to reduce many lines of codes and made the  program less complex. <br>

         <h6> Problem solving techniques </h6>
         <dd>
             <li> Pseudocode  </li>
             TBH, I only used Pseudocode in some challenges, as I am still new to it and most of the time I have got comments and solutions
             on my mind. Its time i start using this technique more.<br>
             <li> Trying something   </li>
             I mostly solved or started towards a neat solution by trying something, something i've done before or a code that is on my mind.
             This trick works a lot, mostly for those who actually want to solve a problem themselves. :) 
             <li>Rubber ducky method    </li>
             In software engineering, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book 
             The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their
              code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. <br>
              I was stuck a lot of times, and just only by de-bugging I got to some solutions. I had some colons missing, or the capitalization, blah blah ! <br>
              <li> Googling  </li>
              This method tops my list, Hehe! I think its easy and more informatic. By doing this, I learnt more than what I have been looking for,
              by juming from sites to sites. <br>
              <li>Asking coaches for help  </li>
              This one is my Last Resort! Usually, I'll be stuck on a problem and I'll text my facilitator asking for help, five to ten minutes later
              I'll probably find a solution. But I am pretty good at asking for help! <br>
