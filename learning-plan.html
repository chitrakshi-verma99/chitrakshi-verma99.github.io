         I grew up in new Delhi, India's capital, big city ,big expectations!
          And when you live there, you are automaticaly indulged in a thing we call "Rat-race". 
          My upbringing was strict but optimistic. From childhood I was taught a lot about the "outside-world".
          I moved to New Zealand when I was 19 and at a young age I was independent (paying my own bils... blah.. blah)
          So I must say that my strengths are that I am confident in what I do,I have a common sense! having an 
          experience in hospitality,I learnt to be patient and work under pressure and short deadlines. Being social 
          is also one os my qualities as I did it for a career! I have managed kithchens before including several staff from different ethinicites, 
          has come in handy in working with people and making good relations.<br>
         Managing myself around other learners and facilitators at EDA would not be a problem at all, 
           I already love the cool vibe here
          I would communicate when I am stuck and ask for help. I surely expect the facilitaion team is patient with my silly questions
          as learning in a different language is very much reliable on revision and reflecting the day. I have to go through a content several times 
          till my brain interprets it in my language!
          
          
          All i really have to take care of is my cat (son) Ziggy Startdust,This one at the bottom. So I do not really have other commitments to 
          do besides play squash, I am the member of Inglewood Squash club. Pretty amazing sport!
