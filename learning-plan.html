            I grew up in new Delhi, India's capital, big city ,big expectations!
            And when you live there, you are automaticaly indulged in a thing we call "Rat-race".
            My upbringing was strict but optimistic. From childhood I was taught a lot about the "outside-world".
            I moved to New Zealand when I was 19 and at a young age I was independent (paying my own bils... blah..
            blah)
            So I must say that my strengths are that I am confident in what I do,I have a common sense! having an
            experience in hospitality,I learnt to be patient and work under pressure and short deadlines. Being social
            is also one os my qualities as I did it for a career! I have managed kithchens before including several
            staff from different ethinicites,
            has come in handy in working with people and making good relations.<br>
            Managing myself around other learners and facilitators at EDA would not be a problem at all,
            I already love the cool vibe here
            I would communicate when I am stuck and ask for help. I surely expect the facilitaion team is patient with
            my silly questions
            as learning in a different language is very much reliable on revision and reflecting the day. I have to go
            through a content several times
            till my brain interprets it in my language!


            All i really have to take care of is my cat (son) Ziggy Startdust,This one at the bottom. So I do not really
            have other commitments to
            do besides play squash, I am the member of Inglewood Squash club. Pretty amazing sport!

        <ul>
            <li> <b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </b>   <br>
                My long term goal here is to become skilled enough to be a Full-Stack Web Developer. I want to come out
                as an successfull student
                and grab a good opportunity when it shows up! So far this course has challenged me in several ways to
                show my problem-solving side. I am pretty happy with it.
                I would like to build multiple Applications as new buissness venture :D </li>

            <li>  <b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</b> <br>
                I reckon I am the person who can go with the flow, so if there is pressure during Bootcamp, i'll
                probably go through it.
                During past few weeks, i've come to know that a goodamount of reseach is needed and determination is the
                key!
                My limitations are that I always try to look for the logic behind everycode, sometimes its just code.
                Also my knowlegde is
                limited to a certain extent in IT, so I go slow and try to absorb as much as i can. </li>

            <li> <b>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</b> <br>
                My non-tecnical challenge would be being studious. Sitting at a place for a long time is not eady for
                me, as I've been a chef
                for past 8 years and is used to standing a moving around a lot ! So wish me luck, I can just focus at
                being at a place. </li>

            <li>  <b>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? </b><br>
                So far, the team here at Enspiral have been great. I love the vibe and the support I get.
                I do not have any specific expectations from the team just the same ones from before , to be patient
                with my learning,
                as I think I still have a bit of slip when interpreting what has been asked by the challenge.</li>

            <li> <b>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp? <br></b>
                My own expectations from myself during this Bootcamp would be to be patientwith myself too!
                I expect myself to be helpfull to others and also at the same time ask for help if needed.
                Moving into a stressful period where there will be a huge amount of new learning for me, I expect myself
                to put my best efforts in,
                and make sure i am revising at the end of the day. I should be having a routine for 9 weeks to get me
                through this course and daily
                errands. I am a person who likes to work in teams and have good leadership qualities. I am looking
                forward to Bootcampand see how things go.</li>
        </ul> </p></div>
